This is a twitch bought written in .NET Core 7 using TwitchLib and a MariaDB backend. Currently it is written specifically my use but am currently making it more generic for others to use. 

Here are just some of things I need to re-work to make it so others can use:

* Customize response strings (Allows streamers to set custom responses and support different languages)
* Enable/Disable entire modules
* Individual module settings for their own uniqueness (This will be slowly done over time)
* Registering credentials easier
* Allow custom Discord commands
* Make Discord commands configurable
* Documentation
* And more items I probably couldn't think of at the time of this writing
