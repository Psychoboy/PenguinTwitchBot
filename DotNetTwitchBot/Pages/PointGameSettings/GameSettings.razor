                <MudText>Most games have a cost outside of the command cost. So when setting costs for games set them here first. To choose which point
                    type a game uses go to <MudLink Href="/pointsettings">Point Settings</MudLink>. Dynamic variables in messages are in format {Variable}
                    so if you see something like {Cost} that is replaced with how much it costs or {PointType} that replaces with the name of the point. 
                    These are just examples but there are more.
